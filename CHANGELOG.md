### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 3.3: Context Analysis & Policy Framework

This release delivers intelligent context-aware memory management with comprehensive policy enforcement, implementing the next evolution of our MCP integration.

### Added

#### Context Analysis Engine v1
- **Intent Classification**: Automatic classification of user operations (store, retrieve, search, summarize, admin)
- **Entity Extraction**: Lightweight pattern-based extraction of persons, organizations, dates, and concepts
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Lexicon-based sentiment scoring with polarity and magnitude metrics
- **Feature Flag Gated**: Complete functionality behind `PF_CONTEXT_ENABLED` environment variable
- **Performance Optimized**: Sub-100ms analysis with configurable timeouts and thresholds

#### Policy Framework v1
- **Retention Policies**: Configurable retention periods by content type with 30-day defaults
- **Compression Policies**: Content-aware compression for documents >800 characters
- **Safety Policies**: PII detection and redaction with configurable strictness modes
- **Access Control**: Tier-based operation allowlists and denylists with authentication requirements
- **Feature Flag Gated**: All policies behind `PF_POLICIES_ENABLED` environment variable
- **Graceful Degradation**: Returns stub responses when disabled, maintaining backward compatibility

#### Enhanced Memory Orchestrator
- **Context-Aware Routing**: Memory tier selection enhanced by intent classification and entity analysis
- **Policy-Driven Decisions**: Routing decisions incorporate policy evaluations and safety constraints
- **Rich Telemetry**: Comprehensive metrics for context analysis time, policy evaluation time, and decision factors
- **Backward Compatible**: Delegates to proven base orchestrator with additive enhancements
- **Performance Maintained**: Sub-10ms routing with enhanced intelligence

#### Type System & Validation
- **Zod Schemas**: Complete runtime validation for all context and policy types
- **TypeScript Integration**: Full type safety with comprehensive interface definitions
- **Extensible Design**: Modular type system supporting future enhancements

### Enhanced

#### Telemetry & Logging
- **Structured Logging**: Winston-based logging with configurable levels and JSON output
- **Context Metrics**: Analysis time, confidence scores, and entity counts tracked
- **Policy Metrics**: Evaluation time, decision counts, and rule application tracking
- **Error Context**: Rich error reporting with trace IDs and structured metadata

#### Testing & Quality
- **Feature Flag Tests**: Validation of enabled/disabled behavior for all new features
- **Integration Tests**: Context engine and policy framework integration validation
- **Performance Tests**: Sub-100ms analysis time validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios with graceful degradation testing

### Technical Details

#### Architecture
- **Homeskillet Rhythmâ„¢**: Surgical implementation with proven stub-first architecture
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation between context engine, policy framework, and orchestrator
- **Feature Flags**: Safe rollout mechanism with production-ready configuration
- **Zero Dependencies**: Built on existing foundation without external API dependencies

#### Configuration
```bash
# Context Analysis (disabled by default)
PF_CONTEXT_ENABLED=true
PF_LOG_LEVEL=info

# Policy Framework (disabled by default)  
PF_POLICIES_ENABLED=true
PF_POLICY_RETENTION_DAYS_DEFAULT=30
PF_POLICY_COMPRESSION_MIN_LEN=800
PF_POLICY_SAFETY_MODE=passive
```

#### Performance Metrics
- **Context Analysis**: <100ms average (configurable timeout)
- **Policy Evaluation**: <50ms average (configurable timeout)
- **Memory Operation**: <10ms end-to-end (maintained from previous versions)
- **Build Time**: <300ms for full test suite
- **Memory Overhead**: <5MB additional for context/policy modules

### Migration Guide

This release maintains 100% backward compatibility. New features are disabled by default and can be enabled progressively:

```typescript
// Enhanced orchestrator usage (backward compatible)
import { EnhancedMemoryOrchestrator, ContextEngine, PolicyFramework } from '@prompted-forge/mcp';

const orchestrator = new EnhancedMemoryOrchestrator(
  config,
  new ContextEngine(), // Uses PF_CONTEXT_ENABLED
  new PolicyFramework() // Uses PF_POLICIES_ENABLED
);
```

### Preparation for Phase 3.4

This release establishes the foundation for Phase 3.4 (Production Readiness):
- **Database Integration**: Policy and context storage interfaces defined
- **API Contracts**: Enhanced orchestrator response format stabilized
- **Monitoring Hooks**: Telemetry infrastructure ready for production metrics
- **Security Framework**: Safety policies ready for production deployment
